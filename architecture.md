Guard-Shield IDS: Comprehensive Layered Architecture Guide
Below is a deep dive into each layer of the Guard-Shield Intrusion Detection System. For each, you’ll find its role, recommended tech stack, core logic/flow, and strategies for fine-tuning and optimization.

1. Data Ingestion Layer
   This layer captures raw network packets, system logs, and endpoint events, buffers them reliably, and forwards to downstream processors.
   Functionality
   Agents running on endpoints or network taps sniff traffic and logs, then publish to a durable message bus to absorb spikes and guarantee delivery.
   Suitable Tech Stack

- Packet Capture: Npcap
- Agent Framework:Rust (libpnet)
- Message Bus: Apache Kafka,
- Serialization: JSON
- Config ( what to monitor, how to behave and where to send data ) & Discovery ( connects / finds other parts of the system without hardcoding their IPs ): Consul, etcd ( key value store that stores configuration and service discovery information )
- Agents / services : on startup, they pulls configs from consul/etcd
 - New detection microservice is spun up : 
   - It registers itself in consul/etcd with tag like `ml-detection:available`
   - An agent needing to send feature vectors, queries consul/etcd for available detection microservices
   - Consul/etcd returns list of available detection microservices with its IPs
   - If that engine crashes , consul redirects the agent to another available detection microservice
- Security: mTLS (Vault) / SASL-SSL (Kafka)
  Core Logic & Data Flow
- Agent bootstraps by fetching interface list and filters from Consul/etcd.
- Kernel-level BPF filters drop irrelevant traffic (ARP, multicast).
- Batches of packets/logs are serialized into JSON.
- Messages published to Kafka topics partitioned by host or tenant.
- On broker lag, agent spills to local disk queue for later replay.
  Fine-Tuning & Optimization
- Use DPDK/PF_RING to bypass kernel and achieve >1M pkts/sec.
- Adjust batch size (e.g., 500–1,000 packets or 50–100 ms windows) to balance latency vs throughput.
- Enable LZ4 compression on Kafka topics.
- Partition topics by tenant/network segment.
- Pin capture threads to dedicated CPUs and assign real-time scheduling.
- Monitor agent metrics (publish rate, lag, drops) via Prometheus and alert on anomalies.

2. Stream Processing & Feature Extraction
   Transforms raw events into structured feature vectors in real time for detection services.
   Functionality
   Consumes messages from the bus, enriches and aggregates data into flows, then outputs feature sets for ML and rule engines.
   Suitable Tech Stack

- Stream Engine (performs operations on data streams in real-time) : Apache Flink
- Enrichment: GeoIP (MaxMind), DNS resolver services
- Microservices: Golang
- Storage: Redis (stateful window storage), RocksDB (embedded)
  Core Logic & Data Flow
- Stream engine subscribes to Kafka topics.
- Performs windowed aggregations (e.g., 5 sec flow stats, session durations).
- Enriches each record with geo-IP, DNS, user-agent parsing.
- Emits normalized feature vectors to “features” topic or Redis.
  Fine-Tuning & Optimization
- Tune parallelism slots/executors for target throughput.
- Use checkpointing and state backend (RocksDB) for fault tolerance.
- Optimize window sizes to capture meaningful session patterns.
- Cache enrichment lookups with TTL in Redis.
- Monitor back-pressure and scale stream jobs horizontally.

3. Detection Layer
   Hosts signature-based and anomaly-based detection engines to flag malicious activity.
   Functionality
   Applies YARA/Suricata signatures and ML models to feature streams, issuing alerts on matches or anomalies.
   Suitable Tech Stack

- Signature Engine: Suricata, YARA
- ML Serving: TensorFlow Serving, ONNX Runtime, TorchServe
- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
- Model Storage: S3/Blob, Model Registry (MLflow)
  Core Logic & Data Flow
- Detection microservices subscribe to feature streams.
- Signature service loads and updates rule sets in real time.
- Anomaly service fetches latest model (Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) and runs inference.
- Each detection produces an alert event with metadata and risk score.
  Model Architecture
- Isolation Forest: ensemble of randomized trees, trained on benign traffic.
- Autoencoder: shallow neural network reconstructing input; high reconstruction error → anomaly.
  Fine-Tuning & Optimization
- Periodically retrain models with fresh data via batch jobs.
- Use canary deployments for new model versions.
- Profile and batch inference requests to maximize GPU/CPU utilization.
- Prune or quantize models for faster serving at the edge.
- Continuously refine rule sets to reduce false positives.

4. Alerting & Automated Response
   Correlates alerts, applies risk scoring, and triggers automated or manual responses.
   Functionality
   Aggregates detection events, enriches them, deduplicates, and orchestrates responses (firewall, quarantine, tickets).
   Suitable Tech Stack

- Correlation Engine: Apache Storm, Spark Streaming, custom microservice
- Orchestrator: SOAR platforms (TheHive/Cortex)
- Notification: SMTP, Twilio (SMS), Slack Webhooks, Push APIs
  Core Logic & Data Flow
- Correlation service ingests alerts from both signature and anomaly topics.
- Enriches with context (asset owner, vulnerability data).
- Applies risk scoring policies and deduplication rules.
- Sends high-risk events to the orchestrator.
- Orchestrator executes playbooks (e.g., block IP, isolate endpoint, open ticket).
- Notification service informs stakeholders via configured channels.
  Fine-Tuning & Optimization
- Define dynamic risk-scoring thresholds per tenant.
- Implement back-off and retry logic in playbooks.
- Use event batching to reduce API call overhead.
- Monitor orchestration latency and success rates.

5. Storage & Analytics
   Stores hot and cold data for fast querying, reporting, and long-term forensics.
   Functionality
   Maintains recent alerts in a fast store, archives raw data in cold storage, and runs batch analytics for trends and compliance.
   Suitable Tech Stack

- Hot Store: Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, ClickHouse
- Cold Store: AWS S3, Azure Blob, HDFS
- Batch Analytics: Spark, Presto, AWS Athena
  Core Logic & Data Flow
- Detection and correlation services index key events into ES/InfluxDB.
- Raw messages and packet captures are archived to S3/Blob.
- Scheduled batch jobs read cold storage to generate compliance reports, ML training datasets, and dashboards.
  Fine-Tuning & Optimization
- Implement index lifecycle policies in Elasticsearch to roll over and delete old indices.
- Use columnar storage (Parquet/ORC) for batch analytics.
- Enable data compression and tiered storage classes for cost savings.
- Monitor query performance and shard/replica settings.

6. API & Client Interface
   Provides multi-tenant access via web dashboard and on-premise desktop client.
   Functionality
   Exposes configuration, real-time dashboards, reports, and endpoint management through REST/gRPC APIs.
   Suitable Tech Stack

- API Gateway: NGINX, Istio, Kong
- Web Portal: React, Vue.js, Angular
- Desktop Client: Electron.js
- Authentication: OAuth2/JWT, OpenID Connect
  Core Logic & Data Flow
- Clients connect to API Gateway, which enforces WAF rules and rate limits.
- Auth service issues JWTs and enforces RBAC.
- Web/Electron apps subscribe to WebSocket or SSE feeds for live alerts.
- Configuration changes flow back to agents via secure channels.
  Fine-Tuning & Optimization
- Implement HTTP caching (ETag, cache-control) for static resources.
- Use CDNs for web assets.
- Enable offline mode and delta sync in Electron app.
- Monitor API latency and error rates, and autoscale backend replicas.

7. Infrastructure, DevOps & Security
   Ensures highly available, secure, and automated operations across all layers.
   Functionality
   Automates build, test, deployment, scaling, monitoring, and compliance enforcement.
   Suitable Tech Stack

- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins X
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

- CD pipeline deploys to Kubernetes with Helm or GitOps (Argo CD).
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler adjusts replicas based on CPU/memory/ custom metrics.
- Prometheus scrapes metrics; Grafana dashboards visualize system health.

  Fine-Tuning & Optimization
- Right-size pods with resource requests/limits and pod affinity rules.
